## Project Overview

The purpose of this repository is to explore the application of AI and machine learning to ecological data, with experiments focusing on species identification, bioacoustics, and network analysis, among other areas of ecological research.

## Experiments

This repository includes the following Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Missing Link Prediction in Ecological Networks**  
   A notebook exploring the use of machine learning to predict missing interactions between species in ecological networks.

2. **Bioacoustics Classification**  
   A notebook that uses AI to classify species based on bioacoustic data, helping to analyze animal vocalizations for biodiversity monitoring.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with these notebooks:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/EcologicalAI_Experiments.git
   cd EcologicalAI_Experiments
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the notebook you'd like to explore from the Jupyter interface.

## Usage

For each experiment, navigate to the respective notebook in the repository and execute the cells to reproduce the experiment.

For example, to explore the Missing Link Prediction experiment:
1. Open the `missing_link_prediction.ipynb` notebook.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to run the analysis.
